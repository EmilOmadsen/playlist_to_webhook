### 3. Deploy Your App
1. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Select your repository: `EmilOmadsen/yessir`
3. Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app

### 4. Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add these variables:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=d7a59142072e4223a5e94195be60a1d5

```

### 5. Update Spotify Redirect URI

2. Find your app
3. Add this redirect URI:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.railway.app/callback
   ```
   (Replace `your-app-name` with your actual Railway app name)
